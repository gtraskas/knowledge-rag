# To Do List

[ ] 1. Testing and Debugging
Test the /search/ and /generate/ endpoints thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
Debug any remaining issues, such as edge cases for different file types or invalid inputs.

[ ] 2. Enhance the Frontend
Improve the Streamlit interface for better user experience:
Add progress indicators for long-running tasks like vectorization.
Display search results and generated responses in a more user-friendly format.

[ ] 3. Add Logging
Implement logging in the backend to track errors and requests for better debugging and monitoring.

[ ] 4. Dockerize the Application
Update the Dockerfile to include both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend.
Create a docker-compose.yml file to manage both services.

[ ] 5. Deployment
Deploy the application to a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
Alternatively, use a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

[ ] 6. Documentation
Update the README.md with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and use the application.
Include examples of supported file types and queries.

[ ] 7. Add Unit Tests
Write unit tests for the backend endpoints to ensure reliability and maintainability.
